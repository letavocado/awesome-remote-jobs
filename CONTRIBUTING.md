# Contributing Guidelines

- Add single resource in one pull request as it will allow for easier review.

- Pull request title should include resource name and resource section.

  - Example: `[VueJobs] -> [Vue]`

- Provide a link to submitted resource in pull request comment section for easier access without copy paste.

  - Example: `Link: https://vuejobs.com/`

- Double check if the resource is truly free without any kind of hidden surprises.
